# MS_AI_PROJECT
# 😊 Real-Time Emotion Detection

A deep learning project to detect human emotions from facial expressions in real time using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and OpenCV.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV
- Dataset: FER2013 (48x48 grayscale images, 7 emotions)

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time emotion detection via webcam
- Trained CNN model with 7 emotion classes
- Face detection using OpenCV

## 🛠️ Setup
```bash
cd emotion-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt
python detect_emotion.py


## Dataset
This project uses the FER2013 dataset. You can download it from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013) and place it in the `/data` directory.
